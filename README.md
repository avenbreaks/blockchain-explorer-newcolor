<p align="center">Blockchain Explorer for inspecting and analyzing EVM Chains.</p>


Block Explorer Gitshock provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use interface for users to view, confirm, and inspect transactions on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchains. This includes the tGTFX Network, Gnosis Chain, Ethereum Classic and other **Ethereum testnets, private networks and sidechains**.

See our [project documentation](https://docs.gitshock.com/explorer) for detailed information and setup instructions.

## About Gitshock Scan

Gitshock Scan is an Elixir application that allows users to search transactions, view accounts and balances, and verify smart contracts on the Ethereum network including all forks and sidechains. this project forked from [BlockScout](https://docs.blockscout.com/) 

Currently available full-featured block explorers (Etherscan, Etherchain, Blockchair) are closed systems which are not independently verifiable.  As Ethereum sidechains continue to proliferate in both private and public settings, transparent, open-source tools are needed to analyze and validate transactions.

## Supported Projects

BlockScout supports a number of projects. Hosted instances include tGTFX Cartenz, Buitenzorg Chain.
